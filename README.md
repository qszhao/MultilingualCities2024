# Integrated Geospatial Methods for Multilingual Cities: Combining GPS, Electronically Activated Recorder, and Map-based Ethnographic Interviews

# Introduction
This github repo deposits the data and code to classify English/Gaelic language usage based on open source English and Gaelic data. More details about the training datasets can be found below: 

The English dataset for machine learning training was sourced from:  https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09344  and for Gaelic we drew on: https://learngaelic.net/ and https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06wqg4h/episodes/guide.
